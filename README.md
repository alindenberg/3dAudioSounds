# Classroom Seating (3d Audio)
 This application is built using the ReactJs framework as well as the Web-Audio-Api for 3D sound. The goal is to aid students when selecting a seat in a classroom at UF. The application allows you to select from an array of modeled UF classrooms, as well as any seat within that classroom, and configure a variety of relevant sounds at different settings in order to get a true feel for what an average class in that seat would sound like.
